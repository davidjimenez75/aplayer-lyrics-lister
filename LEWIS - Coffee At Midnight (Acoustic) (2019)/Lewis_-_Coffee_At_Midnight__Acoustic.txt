Coffee At Midnight (Acoustic) (2019) - LEWIS

Coffee at midnight
No words, just your eyes
Sit in the silence
Take in the quiet

Can I pull you down?
Lay here just shut out
Whatever they say
Baby, just for today

Flashback, his hand on my neck
Brown eyes, my guy, my love
Mistakes, heartbreak, we say you can't take
This love from us

Now it's getting serious
Talking about the real stuff
I don't know what to do
Can't live this life without you

Can we just slow down?
Stop trying to figure it out
I don't know what to do
I'm still crazy about you

Flashback, his hand on my neck
Brown eyes, my guy, my love
Mistakes, heartbreak, we say you can't take
This love from us

Flashback, his hand on my neck
Brown eyes, my guy, my love
Mistakes, heartbreak, we say you can't take
This love from us

Now we're sitting in your car
And I wonder where we are
Why did we come this far
Just to give up

You were everything I need
And now I'm struggling to breathe
Why did we have to fall in love

You were everything I need
And now I'm struggling to breathe
Why did we have to fall in love

Flash back, my head on his chest
He's wearing that shirt I love
Regret that day when we said
You can't take this love from us

Coffee at midnight
No love in your eyes
Can't take the quiet
Sit in the silence
